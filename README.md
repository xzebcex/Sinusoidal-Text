# Sinusoidal Text

This code allows the user to submit a message that will be displayed in a wavy pattern using the sine function. The code begins in a terminal window, and the size of the window is automatically determined.

## Usage
1. Run the code by typing python3 sinusoidal text.py.
2. Enter the message you want to display (maximum length is half of the terminal window).
3. Until the application is ended, the message will be shown in a wavy pattern.
4. Press ctrl-c to exit the application.

## Requirements
•	Python3
•	math library 
•	shutil library 
•	sys library 
•	time library 

## Limitations
1. If the terminal window is enlarged while the application is running, the code may fail.
2. The code may not operate properly if the font size of the terminal window is altered.
